How to Create A Online Wiki
===========================

    :local:


Overview
========

In our examples we create a Online Wiki by using `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
to host our documents online. In our examples we also sign into Read the Docs using
a `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ account and create and use repositories with the account.

..  note::

    Be prepared to give Read The Docs some admin privileges on your GitHub account. If you do not feel comfortable
    with this on your existing account I suggest creating a new one. There are alternatives like
    `Manually importing your docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html#manually-import-your-docs>`_
    but that is not currently covered in our examples here.

Test Read The Docs by Loading a Demo Project
============================================

..  note::

    The following example only has you create a demo project using a `template repository <https://github.com/readthedocs/tutorial-template>`_.
    You do not own the template repository, so you cannot make edits to it. If you want to start
    your own documentation see :ref:`Create Your Online Wiki From A Template`.

#.  After you have setup your Read the Docs account open your profile.
#.  If you have no projects, your dashboard should display a link to **Import our own demo project**. Clicking this link
    will cause Read the Docs to create a demo project and take you to a
    url like ``https://readthedocs.org/projects/<username>-demo/`` which is the new project's overview page.
#.  From the overview page you can view the generated documentation by clicking on the **View your documentation**
    button. There you will see that the docs are viewable at a url like
    ``https://<username>-demo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/``.


.. _Create Your Online Wiki From A Template:

Create Your Online Wiki From A Template
=======================================

If you have not created your own documentation, you can begin by using the template provided by Read The Docs. This
section is based of the `Getting Started <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/#getting-started>`_
section from the Read The Docs tutorial documentation.

Starting Your Repository From A Template
----------------------------------------

#.  Go to the `Read The Docs GitHub template <https://github.com/readthedocs/tutorial-template/>`_.
#.  While signed into GitHub, click the **Use this template** button.
#.  Give the repository a name.
#.  Set it's visibility to **Public**
#.  Click the **Create repository from template** button.

Setting Repository up with Read The Docs
----------------------------------------

#.  Go to `readthedocs.org <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ and sign in
#.  Go to your dashboard and click on the **Import a Project** button
#.  Click the **refresh** button so that Read the Docs can search through your public repositories.
#.  Click the **plus** button next to the repository you want to import into Read the Docs
#.  The next page allows you to set details about your project. Click the checkbox towards the end of the details
    page to see more advanced options.
#.  Click the **Next** button. This will direct you to the project homepage

..  note::

    *   After creating your project, Read the Docs will try to build the documentation. You can see the build logs
        by clicking on the **Build** section in your project page.
    *   You can view your documentation by clicking on the **View Docs** Button in your project page. By default
        the url for your docs will be formatted as ``<project_name>.readthedocs.io/en/latest``

Once the project is created, you will need to update its configurations:

#.  Click the âš™ **Admin** button to go to the settings page
#.  Add text to the empty Description section.
#.  If you have a homepage, put the url here.
#.  Add any relevant tags to your project. For example if your project is food based the tags you enter could be
    "food, veggies".
#.  To save your changes click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
#.  Click on the **Nofifications** section on the left hand side of the settings page. Put an email under the
    email notifications section to get notifications when the build of your project fails.
#.  Click on the **Advanced Settings** section on the left hand side of the settings page. Check the
    **Build pull requests for this project** box. This means that Read the Docs will build the documents
    when a pull request is open and when a new commit has been pushed.
#.  Save the settings by click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.

..  note::

    *   Building pull requests is useful as it allows you to preview changes to your documents in Read the Docs
    *   If you want to preview the build locally instead of having Read the Docs build it do the following::

            # Install sphinx. If you have a conda environment simply run the following
            $ conda install sphinx

            # If you are using the default sphinx_rtd_theme install it.
            $ conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels sphinx_rtd_theme

            # Navigate to your docs folder
            $ cd docs

            # Build the HTML Files
            $ make html

    *   The html files will be built to ``docs/build/html`` and can be viewed in the browser.
        for more information see :ref:`Viewing A Local Wiki`.

    ..  note::

        If bullets are not rendering in your locally generated document you may need to install docutils by running
        ``conda install docutils=0.16`` from the terminal
        (`Link to Stack Overflow Issue <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67542699/readthedocs-sphinx-not-rendering-bullet-list-from-rst-file>`_).

    ..  note::

        We have had issues with the search function not working in locally generated document when using sphinx_rtd_theme.
        From experience installing the theme using the command ``$ conda install sphinx_rtd_theme`` sometimes gave us
        an out of date version of sphinx_rtd_theme that has a documented history of search issues.
        As of 2022 the command ``$ conda install -c conda-forge --override-channels sphinx_rtd_theme`` ensures the download
        of an an updated version of sphinx_rtd_theme through conda-forge.


Make the Template Your Own
--------------------------

..  note::

    If you decided to create a new github account when creating your project, remember to adjust your git config settings
    so any changes you commit to the repository are attached to the new account. For example:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        # set local git username
        $ git config --local user.name "JeffCube99"

        # set local git user email
        $ git config --local user.email myemail@gmail.com

If you have followed the above instructions and built the documentation from the
`Read The Docs GitHub template <https://github.com/astrojuanlu/tutorial-template/>`_ you can follow these steps to
start making the project your own by doing the following:

#.  Remove the ``lumanche.py`` file from your repository. If your documentation repository includes a python package you
    can refer to the Read the Docs `Folder Structure <https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/folders.html>`_
    pages on how to structure your repository for documentation and your python project.
#.  Update the README.rst file
#.  Inside ``pyproject.toml``, Update the project name and authors.
#.  Inside the ``docs/source/`` folder, remove ``api.rst`` and ``usage.rst`` since those
    files were part of the template documentation.
#.  Inside ``docs/source/conf.py`` update the project and author names and change the copyright name to the author name.
    For example::

        project = 'WikiHub'
        copyright = '2021, JeffCube'
        author = 'JeffCube'

    Also change the version number (to ``0.0.1`` if you are just starting) and set the release number equal to the version
    number::

        version = '0.0.1'
        release = version

#.  Update the contents of ``docs/source/index.rst`` This is the homepage of your documentation.

From this point the wiki is now your own. Start adding new ``.rst`` files of your own to ``docs/source``.

Git LFS Support
---------------

At some point you may want to add images to your wiki and track those images using Git LFS. As of this writing
(1/22/2022) Read the Docs does not support Git LFS [0]_. However we can work around this by following the steps
below:

..  note::

    The workaround below combines 2 methods from [1]_ and [2]_.

#.  Install `Git LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ on your local machine. You can start tracking file types
    like so:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        git lfs track "*.png"
        git lfs track "*.jpg"

    Commit any changes you make like the tracking information added to ``.gitattributes``
#.  [Optional] Use `git lfs migrate <https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-migrate.1.ronn?utm_source=gitlfs_site&utm_medium=doc_man_migrate_link&utm_campaign=gitlfs>`_
    to convert files on other branches or in your prior commit history to Git LFS.

#.  Inside ``docs/source/conf.py`` add the following lines:

    ..  code-block:: python

        ###################### Fetching images stored through GitLFS ######################
        import os

        # If runs on ReadTheDocs environment
        on_rtd = os.environ.get('READTHEDOCS', None) == 'True'

        # Hack for lacking git-lfs support ReadTheDocs
        if on_rtd:
            if not os.path.exists('./git-lfs'):
                os.system('wget https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/releases/download/v2.7.1/git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2.7.1.tar.gz')
                os.system('tar xvfz git-lfs-linux-amd64-v2.7.1.tar.gz')
                os.system('./git-lfs install')  # make lfs available in current repository
                os.system('./git-lfs fetch')  # download content from remote
                os.system('./git-lfs checkout')  # make local files to have the real content on them

        ####################################################################################

#.  After applying the above changes, you may find that your documentation is not displaying images tracked by
    Git LFS properly.
    When hosting your wiki, Read the Docs seems to move any images it detects inside a directory named ``/_images/``.
    Git LFS interferes with this detection and move process so we must do this manually.
    We accomplish this by moving all images into the directory ``docs/source/_images/``.
    Next we replace ``..  image::`` references like:

    ..  code-block:: rst

        ..  image:: /images/pycharm_git_widget.png

    to:

    ..  code-block:: rst

        ..  image:: /_images/pycharm_git_widget.png
