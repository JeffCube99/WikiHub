Working With Multiple Wikis

Background
==========

When starting out making a wiki for yourself you may have files for every topic you wanted to cover. You may have
organized those files into different directories each one containing documents on different topics. If however you
wanted to publish all these documents online it may be unwise to place them in a single wiki as users searching for documents
from topic_A may retrieve documents from topic_B that make reference to topic_A or simply include keywords also used
by topic_A. Another issue that can arise is managing changes to the wiki. For wikis managed in git, one can face pull
requests containing changes across a variety of different topics. This may become overwhelming to
manage / moderate.

Because of these issues we propose a structure where each wiki gets its own repository. Additionally there can be
one wiki that enables users to search across all other wikis for when the need arises. This leads to
its own issue however, how to manage all of these different repositories. To get a global view of the documentation
as well as provide a easy way to dip into and edit documentation in any wiki we propose a repository that initializes submodules
for each of the different wikis. This is the structure we use for WikiHub


Search Through Multiple Wikis with A Global Wiki (WikiHub)
==========================================================

..  note::

    For more information visit `Read The Docs: Subprojects <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/subprojects.html>`_

#.  We first start by creating a new wiki we can host online with Read the Docs. To do so follow the steps in the section
    :ref:`Create Your Online Wiki From A Template`.
#.  Next we navigate to the project dashboard on Read The Docs and click the âš™ **Admin** button.
#.  Select **Subprojects** from the sidebar and add your other subprojects (wikis) you want to be able to search through
    from your global wiki.
#.  ***May Not Be Necessary**) Navigate back to your project dashboard and rebuild your project by selecting the
    **Builds** button. Then on the builds page click the **Build Version:** button to rebuild versions of your
    project.

After you follow the above steps you should be able to go to the global wiki's documentation, enter keywords in the
search bar. And see search results from all of the wikis you included as subprojects.


Managing Multiple Wikis
=======================

..  note::

    *   This involves using `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_
    *   Because we access all wikis from a single PyCharm project, we assume we are using the same version
        of sphinx and python across all project (e.g. all wikis were setup with Python 3.8)

With each of your wikis contained in different repositories you could simply navigate to each repository when you want
to add changes. However if you want to have a single place to view and edit wikis across multiple repositories I have
found the following workflow to work for me:

*   To start we create a new project

    ..  tabs::

        ..  group-tab:: Windows

            #.  With PyCharm open select **File > New Project...**
            #.  Choose your project location. (e.g. ``C:\PycharmProjects\test_wiki``)
            #.  Under **Python Interpreter** create a new environment using Conda
            #.  Select your python version (For this example we will use ``3.8``)
            #.  Click the **Create** button to create your project.

        ..  group-tab:: Mac

            #.  With PyCharm open select **File > New Project...**
            #.  Choose your project location. (e.g. ``C:\PycharmProjects\test_wiki``)
            #.  Under **Python Interpreter** create a new environment using Conda
            #.  Select your python version (For this example we will use ``3.8``)
            #.  Click the **Create** button to create your project.

*   Once the project is created select the terminal emulator at the bottom of the PyCharm window.
    From the terminal run the followng:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        # Clone each wiki repository
        $ git clone git@github.com:JeffCube99/WikiHub.git

        # Inside ach wiki repository Set your git credentials
        # (If you contribute to the wikis under a different name and email)
        $ cd WikiHub
        $ git config --local user.name "JeffCube99"
        $ git config --local user.email myemail@gmail.com
        $ cd ..

        # Install Sphinx.
        # During this process conda will ask for your permission you to proceed (``Proceed ([y]/n)?``).
        # To continue just type ``y``
        $ conda install sphinx

        # Install any dependencies of the other wikis.
        # For example if a wiki uses the "sphinx-rtd-theme" run  $ pip install sphinx-rtd-theme

*   With the project setup you can now manage the branches of your wikis using the git widget
    at the bottom of the pycharm window:

    ..  image:: /_images/pycharm_git_widget.png

*   Changes made to files appear within the **Local Changes** tab which is visible when clicking on the Git tab at the
    bottom of the pycharm window. By default any new changes appear in the active changelist which is named the **Default
    Changelist**. To better organize your changes you can create a changelist for each wiki by right clicking inside the
    Local Changes window and select **New Changelist**. When you edit a new file and it appears under the Default Changelist
    you can then drag it and drop it to one of the wiki changelists you have created. You can see an example of
    this organization below:

    ..  image:: /_images/pycharm_organized_changelists.png

*   When committing changes using PyCharm's version control window, select the changelist you want to commit before
    clicking the commit button (that looks like a green chechmark). When reviewing the commit make that it contains only
    from the repository you intend to commit the changes to, otherwise you will create a commit across multiple
    repositories (with the same commit message as well).
*   When you want to generate HTML documentation in a wiki. Open the pycharm terminal and navigate to the ``docs``
    folder in the wiki and run the ``make html`` command. For more instructions on viewing your wiki on a browser
    see :ref:`Viewing A Local Wiki`.
